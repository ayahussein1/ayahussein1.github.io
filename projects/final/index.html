    <p>The US is experiencing the highest gasoline prices since the 2008 recession, with prices rising 18.3% in March 2022 after rising 6.6% in February, according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</p>

    <p>In the past year, the average national gas price has gone up from $2.948 in April 2021 to $4.213 per gallon in April 2022, which is a 43% percent increase, according to the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&f=m" target="_blank">U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)</a>.</p>

    <h3>What changed?</h3>

    <p>Perhaps the most significant event in the last few months that could have had an effect on the gas prices is Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24. Gas prices were already rising prior to this due to inflation, but the war has caused it to skyrocket.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>On March 8, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/08/fact-sheet-united-states-bans-imports-of-russian-oil-liquefied-natural-gas-and-coal/" target="_blank">White House</a> announced that President Joe Biden would be signing an Executive Order banning import of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal to the United States.</p>

    <p>The reasoning for this was because they wanted to support their Allies by depriving Russian President Vladimir Putin of the resources he would need to continue this war. The U.S., along with other western allies have implemented these economic sanctions in an attempt to slow down Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>

    <p>The White House made it very clear that they were aware of the effect that this ban would have on gasoline prices. They explained that the production of oil and gas will continue domestically in order to keep up with the demand.</p>

    <p>They also view this as a way to start to shift more towards other forms of energy, mainly a transition into the long-term use of clean, renewable energy. Also, this event could be used to lessen the dependence that the U.S. has on Russian oil.</p>

    <p>Another potential solution to lowering gas prices that can be explored is lowering or suspending the federal or state gas tax, which together can amount to about 50 cents per gallon, according Maciej Kolaczkowski, who is the manager of the Advanced Energy Solutions Industry from the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/03/how-does-the-war-in-ukraine-affect-oil-prices/" target="_blank">World Economic Forum</a>.</p>

    <p>Interestingly, one state has already tried to implement a month-long suspension of the gas tax.</p>

    <h3>Examining the Effect of The Gas Tax in Maryland</h3>

    <p>On March 18, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced a 30-day suspension of the 36-cent per gallon state gas tax. He stated that this action was to “provide some relief from the pain at the pump.” Maryland became the first state to enact immediate suspension of the gas tax, according to <a href="https://governor.maryland.gov/2022/03/18/video-release-governor-hogan-signs-emergency-legislation-to-immediately-suspend-states-gas-tax-for-30-days/" target="_blank">Maryland.gov</a>.</p>

    <p>When this was announced, there was a noticeable decrease in the gas prices across the state almost immediately. By April 4, Maryland had an average gas price of $3.794 per gallon, which was the fifth lowest average gas price in the country, only behind Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri, according to <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/top-trends/?filter%5Baverage%5D=month&filter%5Bregion%5D=st&filter%5Bby%5D=least&filter%5Bfuel%5D=unleaded" target="_blank">AAA</a>.</p>

    <iframe title="Gas Prices by State as of April 4, 2022" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-EPzyW" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EPzyW/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="502"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
    </script>

    <p>However, just as easily as the prices went down during the gas tax holiday, they instantly went up after the suspension was over.</p>

    <p>By May 4, Maryland’s average gas price for gallon went up to $4.269, which is a 12.5% increase from the previous month. This meant that Maryland went from having the fifth least expensive gas price to the 35th most expensive, according to <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/top-trends/?filter%5Baverage%5D=month&filter%5Bregion%5D=st&filter%5Bby%5D=least&filter%5Bfuel%5D=unleaded" target="_blank">AAA</a>.</p>

    <p>Also, the gas price increase of $0.475 in Maryland from April 4 to May 4 was the highest increase in the country, almost double the second highest, which was Michigan with an increase of $0.245, according to <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/top-trends/?filter%5Baverage%5D=month&filter%5Bregion%5D=st&filter%5Bby%5D=biggest&filter%5Bfuel%5D=unleaded" target="_blank">AAA</a>.</p>

    </script>

    <h3>What’s Next?</h3>

    <p>It is clear to see that the suspension of the state gas tax provides short-term relief for the residents of Maryland, however, the temporary nature of the suspension led to a shocking rise in late April and early May, bringing the state back to square one.</p>

    <p>The U.S.’ political and economic leader would need to search for a more sustainable solution to the continuing increase in gas prices, even if it means turning to other countries for assistance.</p>
