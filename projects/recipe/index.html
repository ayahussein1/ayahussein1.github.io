    <h1>Figs and Seared Duck Breasts</h1>
    <img src="figsduck.jpg" alt="Figs and Seared Duck Breasts">
    <p>Very easy to prepare. It just requires a couple more steps and a little more attention. And when I say attention is nothing more than using a sharp knife, scoring the skin with shallow slits in a crisis cross pattern into the duck breast skin and fat, ensuring not to pierce the beautiful meaty flesh underneath it.</p>
    <p>That is all the difficulty that is required for any duck recipe. The best part is cooking it all in one skillet.</p>
    <p>Therefore, quick and easy to make, it only takes 30 minutes. Simple, delicious, and absolutely delicious.</p>
    <p>The most common breeds that are served in restaurants are the <b>Mallard</b> and Muscovy. The white Peking is most used since it has the most tender, and mild flavor. Not as gamey.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Finely grated zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 large garlic clove, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rosemary leaves finely chopped</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon rosemary leaves finely chopped</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black ground pepper</li>
        <li>2 12-ounces each duck breasts, patted dry and scored crosshatch pattern into the skin, do not pierce the flesh underneath.</li>
        <li>6 fresh figs, halved</li>
        <li>Juice of ½ lemon and lemon wedges for serving</li>
        <li>Olive oil to drizzle over it</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl combine the lemon zest, garlic, and 1 tablespoon rosemary with sea salt and pepper. Mix well and rub the mixture all over both breasts.</li>
        <li>Place the duck skin-side down in a large, non-heated, ovenproof skillet. Place the skillet over medium heat and cook until the fat of the duck is rendered, and the skin is golden for 10 to 12 minutes. Pour out most of the fat from the skillet, save for later use.</li>
        <li>Flip the duck pieces over, remove the skillet from the heat, and scatter the figs and remaining 1 teaspoon rosemary all over the figs in the skillet but not on top of the duck.</li>
        <li>Place the skillet in the oven to roast for 5 minutes for medium.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from the oven and turn on the broiler. Transfer the duck breasts to a cutting board, cover them with aluminum foil and let them rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return the skillet still containing the figs and place it under the broiler for about 1 to 2 minutes until the figs are lightly charred. Keep a keen eye on the figs as not to burn.</li>
        <li>Slice the duck and serve with the figs on the side. Squeeze lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil all over the duck and the figs.</li>
    </ol>
