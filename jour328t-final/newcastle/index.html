    <p>Newcastle United has always been one of the biggest clubs in England, with their legends including iconic players such as all-time Premier League top-goalscorer Alan Shearer who has 260 goals.</p>

    <p>However, despite their lengthy history in the top flight, they’ve struggled to compete with the best teams. They haven’t won a first division title since 1927, and although they competed closely with Manchester United in 1995/1996 and 1996/1997, they’ve failed to maintain those levels, dropping all the way down to 13th the following season.</p>

    <p>Since being in the Premier League, they’ve qualified for the Champions League five times, with their last top 4 finish being in the 2002/2003 season. Since then, they’ve been relegated twice and had many midtable finishes.</p>

    <p>Newcastle fans felt that their previous owner, Mike Ashley (who took over in 2007), offered them no hope of going back to how they used to be, with very little financial investment in the team. In October 2021, Newcastle were finally acquired by a consortium involving Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, RB Sports & Media and PCP Capital Partners, all of whom promised immediate changes to the structure of the club.</p>

    <p>One of the first things the new ownership did was remove Manager Steve Bruce from his role after a winless run of eight games that had them in 19th place on only three points.</p>

    <p>They hired Eddie Howe as the new manager on gameweek 12. He helped guide them to their first win of the season on gameweek 15 and then successfully avoided relegation with a run of 12 wins in the last 18 games, which helped them place 11th. They became the first team in Premier League history to avoid relegation after being winless for the first 14 games, which proves the immediate impact Howe had on the team.</p>

    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13590371"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

    <p>That takes us to this season. Newcastle have had by far one of the best seasons in their history as they look to finish in the top four places for the first time in 20 years. They boasted a very impressive 18-game unbeaten run and are currently in 3rd place with 65 points.</p>

    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13590387"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

    <p>Comparing last season to this season it’s clear to see how much they’ve improved overall.</p>

    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13590395"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

    <p>What Howe instilled was not only a much more efficient attacking style of play, with them scoring 61 goals so far (the 6th most in the league), but he’s also created an extremely difficult defense to break down. Newcastle have only conceded 29 goals in 34 games so far, which is the least in the league. The line chart below shows how both their predicted goals conceded and their actual goals conceded has dropped from previous seasons.</p>

    <p>In less than two seasons, Howe is already proving to be a fantastic appointment from the new Newcastle ownership. With this, and promises of future investment, the future of Newcastle looks extremely bright.</p>
