    <p>For a club that previously played in the UEFA Champions League (UCL) for 22 consecutive years, not being able to qualify for the last seven seasons has been detrimental for Arsenal’s reputation. They were deemed as a laughing stock by opposition fans, players, pundits, etc. some even suggesting that they should no longer be considered a big club.</p>
        
    <p>However, something clicked this season. Arsenal not only mathematically secured their position in the top four with five games to spare, which means that they will be playing in the UCL for the first time since 2017, but they also spent the majority of the season as frontrunners for the title, as they held on to first place for an impressive 30 weeks in a row.</p>

    <p>So, what changed?</p>

    <p>Firstly, Arsenal is a team that has been notoriously terrible in away games. It was especially bad in former Manager Arsene Wenger’s final season, 2017/2018, where they picked up only four wins while suffering 11 defeats out of 19 total games.</p>

    <p>As can be seen in the graphic, Arsenal have been by far the best away team in the league this season, picking up 12 wins so far, which is more than any of the previous six seasons.</p>

    <p>Arsenal’s attack has also improved. They’ve scored 83 goals in 35 games so far, which is the most they’ve scored in a single season since the 2009/2010 campaign. Only Manchester City currently have more.</p>

    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13556053"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

    <p>This difference can be accredited to the incredible improvement the Arsenal forwards have made to their output this season. Arsenal are currently the only team in Europe’s top five divisions that have four or more players on ten or more league goals.</p>

    <p>New striker Gabriel Jesus has 10 goals and 5 assists in 23 games despite suffering a 3-month-long knee injury in the middle of the season.</p>
        
    <p>Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Martin Odegaard are three young attacking players that were already at Arsenal who have managed to put up incredible numbers in comparison to last season, as can be seen in the bar chart below.</p>

                <p>Bukayo Saka is a 21-year-old English right winger who already has 132 Premier League appearances for Arsenal. After coming through the youth academy, Saka instantly became a fan favorite, as his goals and assists helped Arsenal get through very difficult games in the last three seasons. This year, Saka has a very impressive 24 goals and assists in 34 games, which is only one behind the record for the most goals and assists in a single season by a player aged 21 or younger, a record currently held by Cristiano Ronaldo and Leroy Sane. He also became the third Arsenal player, after Thierry Henry and Freddie Ljungberg, to score in three consecutive PL games against arch rivals Manchester United.</p>

                <img src="/jour328t-final/img/martinelli.png" alt="Gabriel Martinelli" class="img-fluid">
                <p>Gabriel Martinelli is a 21-year-old Brazilian left winger who signed for Arsenal in July 2019 from fourth-division São Paulo club Ituano. He instantly became a success after he scored twice in each of his Carabao Cup and Europa League debut games. After suffering a 6-month-long knee injury early in his Arsenal career, he struggled to get into the starting lineup in the Premier League. However, this season he secured the left wing position and has made an appearance in every game. In addition to his five assists, he has 15 goals, none of which are penalties. This means that he equalled the PL record for the most number of goals by a Brazilian in a single season, a record set by Roberto Firmino in 2017/2018, which is a huge achievement to have at only 21 years old. He is also currently tied for Arsenal’s top scorer of the season with Martin Odegaard.</p>

                <img src="/jour328t-final/img/odegaard.png" alt="Martin Odegaard" class="img-fluid">
                <p>Martin Odegaard is a 24-year-old Norwegian attacking midfielder who was seen as a child prodigy when he signed for Real Madrid at only 16 years old. However, he drifted into the background when he struggled to get game time and was sent out on loan several times. He ended up signing for Arsenal on loan for half a season in January 2021, only to finally get a permanent contract and he left Madrid that summer. Last season, he scored 7 goals and got 4 assists, which isn’t too bad, however, this season he has a very impressive 15 goals and 7 assists, which is the second-highest total of any midfielder in the league (behind Kevin De Bruyne). This season he was also appointed as the new captain of Arsenal after former captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was dismissed due to disciplinary issues, so this was definitely a season to remember for Odegaard.</p>
