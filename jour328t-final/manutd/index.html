    <p>The 2021/2022 season was Manchester United’s worst ever Premier League campaign, as they only managed to place 6th amassing 58 points total, their lowest ever PL points tally.</p>

    <p>They decided to solve their problems by appointing former Ajax Manager Erik Ten Hag, and giving him new players.</p>

    <p>Instantly the improvement can be seen all across the board, as they have not only already surpassed last season’s total, but they also have more wins, less draws, and less defeats.</p>

    <p>Ten Hag was able to improve the team with the help of new players. Five-time Champions League winner Casemiro was signed from Real Madrid for about $88 million to give the midfield more strength defensively, and also offer leadership skills due to his seniority.</p>

    <p>In addition to Casemiro, Ajax center-back Lisandro Martinez was signed for around $70 million to replace Harry Maguire in the lineup. The Argentinian proved that he was the right fit for Manchester United with his great last-man tackles and his fantastic ability on the ball to help the team build up from the back.</p>

    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-radar" data-src="visualisation/13591431"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

    <p>Martinez and Casemiro’s addition to the squad has helped Manchester United tremendously this season, as they currently have the most clean sheets in the league this season with 15.</p>

                <p>One player that has really stepped up this season is 25-year-old English forward Marcus Rashford. Having joined Manchester United at seven years old, he was promoted to the senior team at only 18 years old, with his first PL game being against Arsenal, a game where he scored twice and got an assist for a third in a 3-2 home victory. He instantly rose to popularity and became a fan favorite. He had a strong start but he really hit form in the 2018/2019 season where he scored 10 goals and got 8 assists, and he continued to improve his numbers after that hitting 17 goals and 9 assists the following season and 11 goals and 11 assists after that.</p>
                <p>However last season was a terrible one for him. Not only was the season riddled with injuries, but he only managed a measly 4 goals and 2 assists, which was his worst ever tally. It got to a point where he was rumored to be sold to a different club and even some fans wanted him out. However, after Ten Hag was appointed, Rashford regained his confidence and has so far accumulated 16 goals and 5 assists. Post-World Cup, he was scoring so frequently that his name was put up as a potential player of the season candidate. Manchester United are now exploring a new contract for him.</p>
