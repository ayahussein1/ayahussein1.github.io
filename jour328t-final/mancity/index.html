    <p>In 2021, Sergio Aguero, who is the Premier League’s all-time non-English record goalscorer, announced that he would be leaving Manchester City after 10 years with the club. He scored 184 goals and won five Premier League titles.</p>

    <p>When asked about Aguero’s departure during their 2020/2021 title celebration, Manchester City Manager Pep Guardiola said this:</p>

    <div class="pep">
        <img src="/jour328t-final/img/pep.gif" alt="Etihad Stadium" class="img-fluid">
    </div>
    

    <p>This is deemed by soccer fans as one of the biggest lies in Premier League history, because not only did Manchester City go on to win the Premier League title again in the 2021/2022 season, but the following summer in 2022 they signed 22-year-old Norwegian striker Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund for around $63 million.</p>

    <p>Even though everyone knew how well he did in Germany, as he had an incredible 62 goals and 19 assists in only 67 Bundesliga appearances, some fans doubted if he would be able to replicate those numbers in the Premier League.</p>

    <p>Those concerns didn’t last very long as he introduced himself to the Premier League by scoring a brace to help Manchester City beat West Ham United away in the very first game of the season. He also has four hat tricks so far and it’s only his first season, which is already a third of the hat tricks record-holder Aguero had in ten seasons.</p>

    <p>On May 3, Halaand scored a goal against West Ham to bring his tally up to 35 goals this season, which meant that he broke the record previously held by Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole for the most goals scored in a single season in Premier League history. This was a record that stood for 28 years, so to break this record at 22-years-old in his first season is unbelievable.</p>

    <p>Manchester City are trying to become the second team, after Manchester United in 1998/1999, to win the treble (Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup), and they also want to become the second club, with Manchester United, to win the PL three times in a row. Despite spending the majority of the season trailing behind a persistent Arsenal team, Haaland’s crazy season has kept them in the race, as he’s scored 39% of their goals this season to keep up with Arsenal who have four different goalscorers on ten or more.</p>
