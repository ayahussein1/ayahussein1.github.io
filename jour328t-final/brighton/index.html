    <p>Since being promoted in the 2016/2017 season, Brighton and Hove Albion managed to narrowly avoid relegation for three consecutive seasons. When Graham Potter was appointed in the summer of 2019, he slowly started to implement a more attacking style for the team.</p>

    <p>By 2020/2021, Brighton established themselves as a very creative and entertaining team to watch as Potter’s ideas were starting to get put into motion. However, there was one glaring issue: the lack of goals. In soccer, you can create all the chances you want, but if you aren’t scoring them, there’s no benefit aside from being fun to watch.</p>

    <p>That season, they managed to mount an impressive 58.4 expected goals (xG) over the course of the season, which was the 5th highest total in the league. However, they only managed to score 40 goals, which was the 5th lowest. This means that Brighton scored 18 goals less than they were predicted to. This proved to be detrimental because Brighton lost and drew many games that they were expected to win. They were far above the relegation zone, but they only placed 16th.</p>

    <p>Giving Argentinian midfielder Alexis Mac Allister more game time and Belgian forward Leandro Trossard’s improvement in the 2021/2022 season did help a lot, however, they still were missing a lot of chances. They had a total of 51.9 xG and they scored 42 goals. So they only scored ten less goals than they were expected to. Despite that, they still placed 9th, which was their first time cracking into the top ten.</p>

    <p>When Potter left in early September to join Chelsea at the start of the 2022/2023 campaign, fans wondered whether the team could continue to have the attacking style that he implemented. However their questions were quickly answered when they appointed former Shakhtar Donetsk Manager Roberto De Zerbi, who maintained and polished Brighton’s attack and helped them to score the goals they needed to keep up with the chances they were creating.</p>

    <p>They currently have 63 goals to go with their 66.3 xG, which is the 5th most in the league. This is what has helped them to challenge for the UEFA Europa League places as they are currently in 7th place only two points off of Tottenham Hotspur with two games in hand.</p>

    <p>Brighton’s recruitment team became known for finding hidden gems such as Ecuadorian defensive midfielder Moises Caicedo, Japanese winger Kaoru Mitoma and Irish striker Evan Ferguson.</p>

    <p>In addition to new signings, all of Brighton’s already existing attacking players have improved since 2020/2021. One player who really stepped up this season is 28-year-old English midfielder Solly March. He signed for the club in 2011 while they were still in the second division and has 250 appearances for them.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>Under Potter’s management, due to his back-three formation, March played a more defensive role, spending most of the time as a right wingback. However, De Zerbi recognized his potential as an attacking player and shifted him to the right wing. As a result, he has 7 goals and 7 assists so far, which not only shows his quality but also shows how balanced he is as both a goalscorer and a creative player. His amazing season led to him being on the 40-player shortlist for FIFA23’s Premier League team of the season.</p>
